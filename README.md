### Primitier Creative Mode Mod ###
Version 0.1         Created by TotalJTM

## Overview and Features ##
This mod adds a creative mode menu to the PrimitierModdingFramework menu. With this mod, you can:
- menu to make wood, stone, leaf, ancient alloy, and iron blocks of various sizes
- menu to :
    - regen health when out of combat
    - antigravity (not useful but "fun")
    - god mode (nothing can hurt you)

Visit this [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/V7-rZTKgckg) to see the modpack in action.

## Installation ##
This mod should be installed with the [PMFModManager](https://github.com/Xgames123/PrimitierModManager).

Open the ```PrimitierCreativeModeFilesV0.1.zip``` file and drag the two zip files ```PrimitierCreativeModeV0.1.zip``` and ```PrimitierModFrameworkJTM_V0.2.1.zip``` into the mod manager. Load order does not seem to matter but I always load the modified framework first.

## Future Mod Additions ##
- [ ] flying through joystick commands
- [ ] statistics menu (runtime statistics, position, rotation)
- [ ] custom home position menu to reset your home and teleport between locations
- [ ] toggle super strength

## PrimitierModdingFramework Changes ##
These changes require updates to the PrimitierModdingFramework base code so these changes will take time:
- [ ] better menu and ui layout
- [ ] better "widgets" so inc/dec of some value is a neat and compact "widget" isntead of 3 (mostly) buttons
