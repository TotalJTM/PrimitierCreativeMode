- menu to :
    - regen health when out of combat
    - antigravity (not useful but "fun")
    - god mode (nothing can hurt you)

## Future Mod Additions ##
- [] flying through joystick commands
- [] statistics menu (runtime statistics, position, rotation)
- [] custom home position menu to reset your home and teleport between locations
- [] toggle super strength

## PrimitierModdingFramework Changes ##
These changes require updates to the PrimitierModdingFramework base code so these changes will take time:
- [] better menu and ui layout
- [] better "widgets" so inc/dec of some value is a neat and compact "widget" isntead of 3 (mostly) buttons
